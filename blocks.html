      <p style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 150%;  ">Delhi</p>
      <p>Delhi, We begin with the region of India that contains the nation's capital New Delhi this is a frequent source of confusion for travelers so to be the clear day is a city and union territory while new daily is a district within the city and it's this district that serves as the capital of India second only to Mumbai in terms of population the city of daily proper is home to approximately 11 million people with 26 million in the greater metropolitan area the city is for better or worse an incredibly overwhelming experience while some find the hustle and bustle claustrophobic the area's long history it's been inhabited for roughly 2,500 years makes it an important cultural hub.</p>
      <p style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 150%;  ">Varanasi</p>
      <p>One of the world’s oldest cities and a world renowned religious town, Varanasi is a must see for anyone who lives or travels in India. My first planned visit to Varanasi over 12 years ago, was cancelled when Indian Airlines delayed my flight. I had always fantasized about finally seeing this religious town in India and marvel at its wonder as I sailed down the Ganges. I finally achieved my dream just over a year ago, landing in Varanasi after a visit to Khajuraho, full of anticipation and excitement.</p>
       <p style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 150%;  ">Agra</p>
       <p>Sitting at the edge of the majestic Yamuna River, Agra was once the glorious capital of the mighty Mughal Empire at the peak of its power. However, in today’s world, Agra is synonymous with the glorious Taj Mahal. The city remains a popular travel destination among Indian and international travellers alike since the Taj Mahal is both a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the new Wonders of the World. There are many other attractions in the city including forts, palaces, temples, tombs, mosques, lakes, parks and gardens for one to enjoy. Take in sights like the sprawling Agra Fort, which was once the centrehold of the Mughal capital, Shah Jahan’s architectural brilliance reflected in the towering Jama Masjid and Akbar’s ancient city, Fatehpur Sikri, to name a few.</p>
      <p style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 150%;  ">Kerala</p>
      <p>Kerala running along the Malabar Coast this Indian state almost feels like its own distinct country not only is the pace of life notably slower but Kerala boasts its own unique cultural heritage that sets it apart Malayalam this is the state's official language and belongs to the Dravidian group known as the Malayali who make up a 96.7% majority of the population.</p>
     <p style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 150%;  ">Goa</p>
     <p>Goa looking to squeeze some beach time into your travel itinerary you can't ask for much better than go up though it's absolutely tiny compared to the other regions on our list it packs a whole lot of natural beauty and coastal fun into its relatively modest fourteen hundred and twenty-nine square miles of land seafood abounds, the golden beach runs, largely uninterrupted, and the various communities each have something distinct to offer.</p>
